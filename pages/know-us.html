                                DumbHouse real estate was founded in 1983 by Gary Keller and Joe Williams. They started their real estate company out of a single office in Austin, Texas, but quickly started to grow. The company headquarters is still in Austin, and its Mega Camp conference is held in that city annually (when it isn’t held online). The team at Keller Williams real estate strives to be the best agency out there, both in agent support and customer experience. They try to stay on top of the latest technologies so their team members can keep improving the sales process for customers. Navigating the real estate market is complicated. The Keller Williams executive team believes the right training and support can help agents better prepare clients to win negotiations and close deals.
